# JS-Calculator
I created this simple calculator using Virtual Studio Code in plain JavaScript.
The calculator has basic functions.
Addition, subtraction, multiplication and division and the equal button. 
With the DEL button, you can delete one decimal place in the result window. 
The AC button clears everything and resets the calculator. 
It is also possible to use decimals after the whole number. What the "." (dot) indicates.
And local values are indicated by "," (comma).
